# Webapp from scratch

## Description
In this course I will learn to build a web application without frameworks or unnecessary libraries, but with vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript. The end result is a modular, single page web app (SPA). Data will be retrieved from an external API of my choice (imdb.com), manipulated and finally shown in the UI of the App. With the gained knowledge I will be able to build interactive prototypes, based on real data. Besides that, I will gain a better understanding of how API's, frameworks and libraries work.

## API
The API I will be using is from The Movie Database (TMDb). TMDb is an online database with films, television series and everything related to it.

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repository
Type `git clone https://github.com/cenikk/web-app-from-scratch-1920.git` in your terminal.


## Learning goals

* I can add structure to your code by applying patterns. You can defend the choice for the chosen patterns
* I can retrieve data, manipulate it and dynamically convert it to html elements using templating
* I understand how you can work with an external API using asynchronous code
* I understand how you can manage state in your application and you inform the user of state where necessary
